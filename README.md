# RandomPasswordGenerator
A secure password generator that allows users to choose length and included character types.

## Description
As an employee, I want to be able to create a safe and secure password to protect sensative data. By creating a generator using JavaScript that creates a randomized set of characters to be used as my password, I can guarantee a higher level of security because of the randomization aspect. This generator allows me to be specific about the criteria for the generating process, such as number of characters and choice for including the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric characters, and special characters. The access to deciding criteria gives me more control over the password while still making it random and secure. By using JavaScript in this application, I learned a lot about developing a .js file. More specifically, this application honed my logic and math skills as well as my ability to interpret similar applications and code in order to relate it to mine. Much of this application was more advanced than my course has covered, which always increases my googling skills.
